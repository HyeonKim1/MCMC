prior:

  theta0: 
    type: 'gauss'        # if type is 'uni', range is [lower bound, upper bound]
    range: [2, 0.5]      # if type is 'gauss', range is [mean, standard deviation]

  theta1: 
    type: 'gauss'      # if type is 'uni', range is [lower bound, upper bound]
    range: [4, 0.5]  # if type is 'gauss', range is [mean, standard deviation]
